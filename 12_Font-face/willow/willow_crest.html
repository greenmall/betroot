<p class="this">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand <br>
	head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but <br>
	the mass of animals was too great. The buffa oes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening <br>
	bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their <br>
course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain. </p>

<p class="the_travellers"> The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Philes Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, <br>
remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br>
Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.</p>

<p class="what">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impending travel! Partbleu! I <br>
should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive <br>
into this herd of beasts!" </p>

<p class=the_engineer><b><i>â€œ</i></b>    The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he wise. </p>
